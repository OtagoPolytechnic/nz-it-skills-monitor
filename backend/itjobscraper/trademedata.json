These products when unified provide a rich customer capability by leveraging IoT in the use of scaled data assets and predictable insights. Founded with a vision for simplicity in innovation, today, its products and systems are trusted by tens of thousands of companies worldwide. The next generation of its growth builds on its current SaaS offering and building a scaled platform to capture device data and service up insights, controls and capability.Your role:You will champion the technical using a flexible design, crafting code and scripts, working with multiple teams to build the Platform. The needs of the deployment of the tech here means the Platform can be Cloud-native, hybrid or even delivered on-prem for those customers that require ‘lockdown’ level of high security. Think API-first, highly-integratable given the number of systems it will be expected to communicate with low-data, high-frequency.You will be building a Cloud platform that will be used for a prolific number of IoT devices in multiple instances. Tech is flexible, delivering the solution that best meets the needs of the business. Currently there is some Azure, but this next-gen can harness AWS, Azure, even GCP. Tooling is again flexible. They have the smarts in the business, just not a high degree of experience in crafting this type of technology. Scripting is critical and the move to infrastructure-as-code is underway, but this role will need to drive this contemporary thing in the business and the engineering teams. You will need to be involved in building API Gateways, Cloud Architecture, Application Architecture and even Data Storage and enablement of reporting down the track. Maybe make it hybrid too please?The fit:If you enjoy building scalable platforms that make commercial sense and can adapt to deployments in a Cloud-first, hybrid and sometimes on-prem capability for a global vendor, here you are. You’re coming in right at the beginning of the design phase, so if you want to pontificate on the correct solution design and you enjoy shipping code and the latest tooling in this space then again, here it is.The technical skills cover core Cloud platform technologies including (Azure and/or AWS). Currently there is embedded technologies, hardware, but you won’t need to touch this. There is some .Net, but they are not wed to this, but experience with IoT would be ideal and the ability to deal with the data challenges it brings. The technology selection will depend on the needs of the platform. You will understand API gateways and the ability to engineer rapidly scaling instances in a secure environment. Given the nature of the customers and the product set, again being dogmatic about Cloud won’t help, so the scope of experience to apply pragmatic Cloud-first, hybrid and from time-to-time on-prem deployment will be very useful.There may well be a path to leadership here in people and delivery, but for now you’ll love the technical nature of what you do.This is an exciting opportunity to be part of this company’s growth, please apply online iif you are ready to go on this journey with them.Please note, only applications from job seekers who hold a valid work visa / permanent residents or NZ citizens, presently based in New Zealand, will be considered.REF:15420", "location": "Auckland", "company": "Potentia", "duration": "Full time", "category": "other", "source": "seek", "skills": "[{\"name\": \"azure\", \"type\": \"platform\"}, {\"name\": \"aws\", \"type\": \"platform\"}, {\"name\": \"gcp\", \"type\": \"platform\"}, {\"name\": \".net\", \"type\": \"language\"}, {\"name\": \"api\", \"type\": \"protocol\"}, {\"name\": \"scripting\", \"type\": \"tool\"}, {\"name\": \"communication\", \"type\": \"soft skill\"}, {\"name\": \"adaptability\", \"type\": \"soft skill\"}, {\"name\": \"problem solving\", \"type\": \"soft skill\"}]", "salary": 0, "date": "2024-10-18", "type": "None"},
