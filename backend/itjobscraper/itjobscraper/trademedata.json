Imagine being the first company in the world to track not just what people buy, but why and when they choose certain products. That’s what we do. We’re pioneering a brand-new approach called Share of Occasion, giving food brands real-time insights into consumer behaviour, backed by data no one else has access to.For years, market research has been slow, expensive, and out of reach for many. Only the biggest food companies with large budgets could afford to get insights on shopper habits. We’re changing that. Our data isn’t just about who’s buying what—it’s about the real motivations behind those choices, from grocery planning to product usage. This is a game-changer for marketers in the food industry, empowering them to make smarter, faster decisions that directly drive growth.We’re disrupting the market by bringing these insights to life through our shoppable recipe platform, already loved by over 60,000 households in New Zealand and Australia. Think of it as the ultimate meal-planning tool, where consumers find their perfect recipes and brands get invaluable data on consumer choices.Why does this matter? Because we’re unlocking insights that food brands have never had before—showing them their true competition, and helping them stay ahead by deeply understanding their customers’ needs and habits.

Halter enables farmers to remotely shift, virtually fence and proactively monitor their cows’ health and behaviour. Can you imagine watching 500 dairy cows turn in unison and walk calmly towards the milking shed? No quad bikes, no dogs, no fences. Just a mob of cows walking at their own pace.
